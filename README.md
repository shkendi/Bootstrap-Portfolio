# Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio

​

## Description

In this challenge I am required to build a personal portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework. This will help me put in practice all the knowledge I've been given from the instructor during the class. This is only the beginning and it will be a bit hard to get all the technical requirements perfectly done, However, this is a good start for what point to get started with.

​

## Technical Requirements

1. Bootstrap
2. HTML
3. CSS

- Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.
  ​
- Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.
  ​
  - We use the mantra “commit early and often.” This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!
    ​
  - Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.
    ​
- Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.
  ​
  - When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.
    ​
- We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
  ​

    ​
    The website should include the following bootstrap components:
